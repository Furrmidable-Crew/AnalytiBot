## How to use it

To initiate Cheshire Cat's data analyst functionality, we recommend using the formula **"Analyze the dataset for"** followed by your desired query.

To perform the desired analysis you need:
(1) upload a csv containing the dataset
(2) query the dataset in natural language

The CSV (Comma-Separated Values) must respect the "CSV basic" format, that is:
- Field Delimiter: Comma (,)
- Newline character: \n (Unix) or \r\n (Windows)
- No Quotes: No values ​​enclosed in quotation marks, which means that values ​​cannot contain the delimiter (comma), newline characters, or quotation marks.

Example:
Name, Surname, Age
Mario, Rossi, 30
Anna, Bianchi, 25
